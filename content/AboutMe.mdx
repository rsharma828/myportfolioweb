summary: "I am Rupesh Sharma, a passionate and driven software developer currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology at the National Institute of Technology Agartala, with a CGPA of 8.61. My technical expertise spans C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL, which I have applied to a range of projects.

Among my notable projects are **DocQuify**, a platform designed for context-aware querying of PDFs using OpenAI and PostgreSQL, and **PayUp**, a digital wallet app with secure money transfer features and bank integration. Both projects highlight my ability to develop secure, efficient, and user-friendly applications with robust back-end architectures.

My academic journey is complemented by my achievements, including ranking among the top 25k students in JEE Advanced and securing District Rank 10 in the Intermediate Exam. I am also deeply involved in extracurricular activities, serving as the Technical Lead for ANARC (the Robotics Club of NIT Agartala) and as the captain of the NIT Agartala Hockey Team. These leadership roles have strengthened my collaboration, communication, and teamwork abilities.

I am always excited to tackle new challenges, develop innovative solutions, and work with teams that are passionate about technology and creating a meaningful impact."
