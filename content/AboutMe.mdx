summary :  

I am Rupesh Sharma, a passionate web developer currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology at the National Institute of Technology, where I have achieved a CGPA of 8.61. I have developed strong proficiency in C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.  

During my Full Stack Internship at Kraffic Media, I played a key role in maintaining and optimizing client websites, ensuring seamless integration of new features while keeping up with evolving specifications. I have also worked on projects like **DocQuify**, a platform that enables context-aware querying of PDFs using OpenAI and PostgreSQL, and **Pay-Up**, a secure digital wallet app for money transfers and bank integration.

In addition to my technical work, I have taken on leadership roles, including serving as the captain of the NIT Agartala Hockey Team and as the Technical Lead for ANARC, the Robotics Club at NIT Agartala. These experiences have helped me develop strong problem-solving, teamwork, and leadership skills.

I am dedicated to continuous learning and aspire to create innovative solutions in software development, especially in AI and web technologies, to address real-world challenges.
